The islandora_solr_search module allows users of the Islandora fedora repository
to search their Fedora Repository with a properly configured Solr instance.

The code in this module is dependant on the PHP Solr Client, available from
http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client

This code used to display search results can be modified through an external customization
module.  Islandora_solr_config has been included as a template to show how this is done.
