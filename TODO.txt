High priority
-------------

- update README.txt
- update hook_help functions
- create islandora_solr.api.php
- check if islandora_solr.install is doing the right things.
- there's an issue if a solr query is executed programatcially. The query block
shows up. Really need to rethink how blocks are rendered and when/how
IslandoraSolrResults is called
- add a check to see if the context is the search results page. Currently we
check if IslandoraSolrQueryProcessor::display is set, which is not ideal.

Normal Priority
---------------

- check if spaces could be replaced by + or %20 , which would simplify some functions (splitting strings)
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters#sort
- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- table display works but should be rendered through a template file.

- check luke for multivalue on sort
- add watchdog messages on error.
- on query without filter parameters the delete link adds a ? or &
- some snippets of markup could go in theme functions

Low Priority
------------

- expose result limit controls
- put object url's in a global variable?
- Boolean operators as query seem to choke

- when changing primary display, keep &limit in the url or should it show the default? Displays can override this though.
- empty query with dismax seems to return the same as no dismax (maybe it's just how solrconfig is defined)
