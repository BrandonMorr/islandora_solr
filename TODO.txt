TODO:
=====

High priority
-------------

- expose sort and result limit controls (block? dropdowns?)

- update documentation + doxygens
- create islandora_solr.api.php


Normal Priority
---------------

- update translation file
- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- check fixes in advanced_block branch, I might have forgotten some.
- table display works but could use some improvement.

- check luke for multivalue on sort

- empty query with dismax seems to return the same as no dismax (maybe it's just how solrconfig is defined)

Low Priority
------------

- put object url's in a global variable?
- Boolean operators as query seem to choke
- sort without order chokes. Check before adding parameter in processor?

- when changing primary display, keep &limit in the url or should it show the default? Displays can override this though.
- make sure islandora_solr.theme.css is populated and called right.
