=====

High priority
-------------

- update README.txt
- update hook_help functions
- create islandora_solr.api.php
- check if islandora_solr.install is doing the right things.

Normal Priority
---------------

- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- table display works but should be rendered through a template file.

- check luke for multivalue on sort
- add watchdog messages on error.

Low Priority
------------

- expose result limit controls
- put object url's in a global variable?
- Boolean operators as query seem to choke

- when changing primary display, keep &limit in the url or should it show the default? Displays can override this though.
- empty query with dismax seems to return the same as no dismax (maybe it's just how solrconfig is defined)
