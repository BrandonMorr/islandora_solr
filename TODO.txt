Sprint 6
--------

- apply field settings against site
- permissions: gray out roles that have no permission to search solr.
  dsm(user_roles(FALSE, 'search islandora solr'));

- populate popup with forms, including (default) values

- in the rest of the module change how we get variables

- create upgrade path !!

- theme popup / make resizable /
- clean up table headers
- create doxygen code + wrapper doxygen
- clean up code (run through coder)
- merge with 7.x branch

- when populating fields, if a solr field has a label in another field, maybe the default label can be the one already filled out? If the current one is empty still?

- make labels translatable: http://drupal.org/node/1114010

- make nojs fallback
admin/islandora/search/islandora_solr/result_fields?ajax
admin/islandora/search/islandora_solr/sort_fields
admin/islandora/search/islandora_solr/facet_fields
admin/islandora/search/islandora_solr/search_fields

Done:
- pass values from popup back to form
- save the form variables in a DB table
- create all forms and apply to configure callbacks (includes permissions by role)
- make sure you can't add an empty or duplicate field!

High priority
-------------

- check if islandora_solr.install is doing the right things.
- processor object alter call in executeQuery() might conflict with 2nd query calls from the variable date range gap functionality.
- we could save us some code by storing the primary display settings in a DB table
- add luke check for date fields (breaks if not)
- more user friendly controls + advanced option
- settings per date field (now same settings for all fields)
- revert order of date facet fields?

Normal Priority
---------------

- add a check to see if the context is the search results page. Currently we
check if IslandoraSolrQueryProcessor::display is set, which is not ideal.
- update hook_help functions
- add a parameter to the luke function to return a single document.
- check if spaces could be replaced by + or %20 , which would simplify some functions (splitting strings)
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters#sort
- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- table display works but should be rendered through a template file.
- - add ajax_command_changed() to the vertical tabs to show something has changed.
- add watchdog messages on error.
- on query without filter parameters the delete link adds a ? or &
- some snippets of markup could go in theme functions

Low Priority
------------

- update README.txt
- tabledrag should update the table with ajax.
- hook_alter instead of module invoke all for object manipulation
- provide integration with display suite
- expose result limit controls
- put object url's in one variable?
- Boolean operators as query seem to choke

- when changing primary display, keep &limit in the url or should it show the default? Displays can override this though.
- empty query with dismax seems to return the same as no dismax (maybe it's just how solrconfig is defined)
