TODO:
=====

High priority
-------------

- fix simple_table to have it work at least

- permissions
- move extended solr search to advanced block
- add support for sort and result count through url -> check luke for multivalue?

- split css files and js files between .base.css, .admin.css and theme.css
- classes and ID's should have dashed. Also shorten where possible
- fix display (shows up on all pages)



Normal Priority
---------------

- empty query with dismax seems to return the same as no dismax (maybe it's just how solrconfig is defined)
- add dropdowns for sort and result count on search page




Low Priority
------------

- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- put object url's in a global variable?
