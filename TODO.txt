=====

High priority
-------------

- update README.txt
- update hook_help functions
- check if islandora_solr.install is doing the right things.
- add a check to see if the context is the search results page. Currently we
check if IslandoraSolrQueryProcessor::display is set, which is not ideal.

- processor object alter call in executeQuery() might conflict with 2nd query calls from the variable date range gap functionality.

- we could save us some code by storing the primary display settings in a DB table

- add luke check for date fields (breaks if not)
- more user friendly controls + advanced option
- settings per date field (now same settings for all fields)
- revert order of date facet fields?

Normal Priority
---------------

- add a parameter to the luke function to return a single document.
- check if spaces could be replaced by + or %20 , which would simplify some functions (splitting strings)
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters#sort
- don't hardcode php solr library, instead override it.
- table display works but should be rendered through a template file.

- add watchdog messages on error.
- on query without filter parameters the delete link adds a ? or &
- some snippets of markup could go in theme functions

Low Priority
------------

- hook_alter instead of module invoke all for object manipulation
- provide integration with display suite
- expose result limit controls
- put object url's in one variable?
- Boolean operators as query seem to choke

- when changing primary display, keep &limit in the url or should it show the default? Displays can override this though.
- empty query with dismax seems to return the same as no dismax (maybe it's just how solrconfig is defined)
